Process followed for the test framework:

1. Installation and project setup

Created a Java project and added framework support with Maven; imported Maven Cucumber dependencies

2. Documentation

Spent quite some time learning about Cucumber with Java and the Gherkin BDD test language syntax

3. Outlined the test scenario and steps provided by WH and wrote down necessary steps for the features
to be implemented

4. Started writing the .feature files and defining them

5. Worked on parameterizing PlayerLogin.

6. Tried to find a good solution to parameterize the sport events, and the betslip

7. Got stuck on parameterizing the sport events, managed to fix some failing tests

Notes:

I could not complete the tests with page objects refferences and also did not manage to ensure the tests
would run on desktop and mobile devices due to my limited knowledge and exercise with writing automation tests.

This is actually the first test framework i have written.

I really enjoyed the challenge and will keep learning.
